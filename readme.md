Amazing script originally by [Matt Reed](http://middleclasstool.com/), to prompt me to log my time; pops up periodically to ask “What have you been doing?”

1. Open AppleScript Editor
2. Create a new script
3. Copy the contents of [My Log.applescript](https://github.com/simonwheatley/what-you-been-doing/blob/master/My%20Log.applescript)
4. Save the script in the same folder, call it "My Log.scpt"
5. Export the app for the script, `File > Export`, choosing a File Format of `Application`, and ticking the `Stay open after run handler` checkbox, call the App "My Log.app"
